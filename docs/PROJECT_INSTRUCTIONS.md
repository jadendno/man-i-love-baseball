  
A list of all major league baseball stadiums resides at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Major\_League\_Baseball\_stadiums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_stadiums).  A list of all the major league baseball teams reside at [http://mlb.com](http://mlb.com).  You are to write a program that inputs this data and stores this data in a suitable data structure.  (heap, tree, etc.) This data will allow baseball fans to plan their dream vacation.   

The initial souvenir list is a follows

1. Baseball cap			$25.99  
2. Baseball bat			$35.35  
3. Team pennant			$12.99  
4. Autographed baseball		$19.99

1. Write at least 10 agile stories (including description, tasks, test scenarios, and story points) before any software development.  
2. You should create a list of the major league stadiums by name in alphabetical order.  
3. You should create a list of major league stadiums sorted by team name.  
4. You should create a list of American League stadiums sorted by team name.  
5. You should create a list of National League stadiums sorted by team name.  
6. You should create a list of stadiums that have grass surface sorted by team name.  
7. You should create a list of stadiums in chronological order by date opened

**Planning a vacation:**

1. Design a trip to all the major league stadiums with the shortest path starting at a stadium in California.  Print the number of stadiums visited, the order the stadiums are visited, and the total distance traveled.  
2. Design a trip to all the American League stadiums with the shortest path starting at a stadium in California.  Print the number of stadiums visited, the order the stadiums are visited, and the total distance traveled.  
3. Design a trip to all the National League stadiums with the shortest path starting at a stadium in California.  Print the number of stadiums visited, the order the stadiums are visited, and the total distance traveled.  
4. Provide the capability for a baseball fan to plan his/her dream vacation. Print the number of stadiums visited, the order the stadiums are visited, and the total distance traveled.  
5. Provide the capability to track souvenirs purchased by the baseball fans on their trips and the corresponding costs.   
6. Provide the ability to modify stadium information if a team moves into a new stadium. (administrator only)  
7. Provide the ability to add a new team and corresponding stadium if major league baseball decides to expand. (administrator only)  
8. You should be able to randomly access any baseball stadium.   
9. You should be able to modify (add/delete/change) the souvenirs list and their prices. (administrator only)   
10. You should be able to print out the distances between any two stadiums.  
11. You should be able to display the map, or your own version of the map.  The trips should highlight the path traveled.

Submit a UML diagram, state diagram, and use case diagram with your project.

No late projects will be accepted.  Your team must demonstrate your project to me before it will be graded.   Each teammate must identify their accomplishments on the project.  Design a very readable, easy to use interface to demonstrate your program.  Contingency handling should include addressing invalid input. 

The assignment will be graded using the following scale:

|  | Value |
| :---- | :---: |
| Meets Requirements | 8 |
| Style | 3 |
| Use of C++ data structures | 3 |
| User interface (using Qt) | 3 |
| UML diagram, state diagram, use case diagram | 3 |
| Contingency handling | 3 |
| Adherence to Scrum | 3 |
| User stories completed (4/30/25) | 4 |
| Sprint 1 (5/14/25)  | 5 |
| Sprint 2 (5/28/25) | 5 |
| Correct calculation of distances | 10 |
| Total | 50 |
